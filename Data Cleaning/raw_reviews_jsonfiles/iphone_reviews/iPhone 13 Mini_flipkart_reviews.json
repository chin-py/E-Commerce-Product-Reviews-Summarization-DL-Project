Couldn't be happier with my upgrade from the iPhone SE. I recommend using only up to 15W chargers if you want to avoid the phone becoming unusually warm when plugged in. Charge times are still excellent if you want to slip in a quick charge for 20-30 minutes. It should give you enough battery life for half a day."

Battery lasts one full day with mild use(scrolling,calls, taking few pictures etc) , the processor is a beast, handles everything u throw at it. But the main and probably only reason u want to buy this for its ultra compact size which feels great in the hands and ideal for one handed use. Camera is excellent for close and Normal range photography,not for Zoom photography. I really recommend u try this screen size once."

      "Comment": "I upgraded from a six month old 12 mini to 13 mini as I got a good price and I must admit that 13 mini seems far better than 12 mini. Its size to me is ideal as I like small smartphoes. The battery life has improved remarkably from 12 mini. 13 mini is the last mini that can be purchased and so its becoming a collector's item. The packaging was great and the delivery was prompt. Overall a nice experience."
