Again, camera is great. You need to have to tweak some of the settings and you are good to go! Heating is too too dangerous when editing videos in 4k 60fps HDR though an option for 4k is given."

Camera and Video quality may be good but with little difference as compared to other premium Android phones. Data transfer from Android to i-phone is not at all easy as claimed by Apple.
