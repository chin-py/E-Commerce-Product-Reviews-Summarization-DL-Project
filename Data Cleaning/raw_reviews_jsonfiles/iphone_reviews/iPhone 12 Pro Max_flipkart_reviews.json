Photo quality after zooming is also good. Videos are also good. Better to buy Pro Max for longer battery backup. After heavy use, watching movies, battery consumption is 70% per day in average (no idea about backup for game users). Regarding weight, I am used to it.

I faced issue due to which I rated it only 1 star but now I am changing to 5 star as I got my thing resolved as there was some settings changes.\nBattery backup is awesome. As I work in profile where phone plays important role. I use my phone for whole day and my battery drains approx 40-45%\nCamera quality is mind blowing. Specially for outdoor."
