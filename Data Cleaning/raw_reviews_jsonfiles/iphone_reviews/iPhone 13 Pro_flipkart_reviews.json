Camera bump is li'l large as compared to others, but there will be no complain about the camera quality.\nSmooth 120hz display.\nSpeakers perfect no doubt.\nLi'l bit in heavier side as compared to iphone 12.\nThe phone looks amazing.\nIf you have good budget then just go for it."

Not a huge difference in camera but night pictures are definitely an upgrade. The battery life is exceptional. Often use it as hotspot for around 6 hrs and after more than 10 hours, battery is more than 60% if other apps are not heavily used. 120hz feels super smooth.\n\nCons: Price is still very high"

The macro mode, cinematic modes are fun to use. Also, the 120fps screen will slowly but surely grow on you. Overall, if you have got the budget definitely get it."

Camera and display are same but if you have large fingers and need battery to last 2 days with normal use then go for the max model.\nOpt for 256gb model as the promotion is only available in 4k for 256 and above model, it's available in 1080p for 128gb models."
