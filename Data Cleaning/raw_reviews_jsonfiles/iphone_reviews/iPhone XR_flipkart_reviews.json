Don’t make the mistake which I made. Once you buy it, Apple will not own anything of it. You’ll have to bear all the problems and their cost on your own. Please don’t go for it.

When Apple claims that this is the best LCD in a smartphone they mean it. It is the same display found on iPhone 11. The phone is super fast and super smooth. Enjoying the phone. The only issue is delivery! Ordered on 6th and they delivered it on 12th August."
