First of all Apple has created something that is a throwback to the best smartphones ever designed - the iphone 5 and 5S. While doing so Apple made sure that it did not compromise on power or performance. The 12 mini has all the features (ALL OF THEM!) of the bigger iPhone 12 - ...\nREAD MORE"

Phone feels just right in the hand, very easy to type with one hand.\nBattery life could use some work, even with my light use it just lasts a day, so those with heavy use might need to charge this twice or thrice a day. But a smaller battery charges faster so there is that.\nOverall, it was a very good deal for what I paid."
