In love with the telephoto lens. Macro mode is just crazy. You don't even have to make an effort to take macro pictures,just zoom in and the best part is you can keep the device closer to the subject and it will focus without any issues. Detailed camera review in few weeks. Will load more pictures for sure."

Its camera is much better than Samsung S24 ultra. The best powerful processor is Dimensity 9400 and finally its battery backup is very better than Samsung S24 ultra I got 2 days battery backup in normal use.\nIf you want a good mobile with very good camera, battery backup and powerful processor.
