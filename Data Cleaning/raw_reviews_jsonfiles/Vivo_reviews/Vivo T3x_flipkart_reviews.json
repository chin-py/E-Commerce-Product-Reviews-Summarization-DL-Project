      "Comment": "I purchased it due to dual speaker feature for high voice call volume requirement. But it's waste of money. Voice call volume very less. There is flipkart return policy. I approached the service centre, there very reluctant to return and told this is max volume and not can't be increased. So I have to bear this low quality phone without any choice. Request not to buy this if you require sound quality."
