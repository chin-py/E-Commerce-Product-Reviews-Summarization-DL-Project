Overall camera performance is superb, specially in low lights. Bokeh effect is outstanding, close to DSLR. Camera aperture is the largest i have ever seen in a smartphone. If you're expecting high zooming like Samsung s23 ultra then don't go with this phone otherwise it beats Samsung in comparison with pricing as well. 120w charging is superfast and gives a dece...\nREAD MORE"

However, there's more to this ultra flagship than just a great image-capturing experience. You also get top-notch performance, a svelte design, lasting battery, and a vivid display. Overall the X90 Pro masters a lot of smartphone traits but it is an absolute champ with its optical skills.\nWorth buying"
