My primary reason for buying this phone was its camera, and it certainly excels in that department. The rear cameras, especially the main camera and the telephoto camera, are simply brilliant. The photos clicked by these cameras are so good that it's tough to differentiate between them and DSLR photos.\n\nHowever, there are a few negatives to note:\n\n1. **We...\nREAD MORE"

All photos came out with horrendous lens flare and I made up my mind for a camera specific Android phone. I did extensive research between Xiaomi 14 pro, OnePlus 12 and Vivo X100 pro.
