Excellent battery service also fast charging quality\n4, there is a different kind of peace in mind while using the ph as the ph runs smoothly\nThat's it ..... Only one thing that can make you bothered is round shape camera in the centre of the ph that can be little risky. But over all is good, portrait zooming is best quality nd night mood is awsome"

Performance is good but not the best, when you play games at 90fps or 120 fps, the device is getting a noticeable heat. Battery is definitely a plus for its performance, can last long easily a day or 1.5 days. Overall it's a good phone for the price."
