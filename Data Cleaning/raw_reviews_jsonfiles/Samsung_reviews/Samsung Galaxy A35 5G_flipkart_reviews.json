The caller speaker (L) acts as a 2nd speaker so thats why sound quality weakens on default. Depends on person to person.\nA single charge 100% at around 9am will give all day backup (without heavy usage like games and all).\nBut its a go for it phone for sure. No regrets. Delivery was very slow that's the only issue."

Vivo Y200 phone was amazing light weight which gets charged in 20 mins and runs for full day with full operation"
