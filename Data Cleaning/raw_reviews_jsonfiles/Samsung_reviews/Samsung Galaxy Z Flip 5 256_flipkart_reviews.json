      "Comment": "I have been a samsung patron until Note 5. The flip design attracted me. Debated between flip 5 and razor ultra and went with flip, Lavender color. It is a bit heavy phone and slippery too. Ordered Spigen cases but had to return due to their slippery nature. Went with Samsung flipsuit case, expensive but found it gives a better grip.\n\nAs for the phone, it needs improvement. Especially in the transition from the front screen to the inside screen. A software update could help overcome. ...\nREAD MORE"

Battery charging time is very long it takes 2.30mis to charge fully we will get about a day with moderate to heavy usage. Face recognition works fine but finger print does not work properly.\nPros : Design 5*, Display 5*, Camera 5*, performance 5*\nCons : Battery 4*, finger print 1*\nThey should have provided with back case"

Battery backup is average for a heavy usage. But nice one by samsung. Love the way they build the phone. Outer display seems to be really good with small display in it. Disappointment: Charger not available. Overall got it for a good deal."

But the cover screen display is not like Android, it has very limited functionality which I hate a lot. Screen brightness is a biggest issue while using outside. Battery backup is very low and the UI lags sometimes with snapdragon 8 gen 2. I liked OneUI though. No charger provided is a biggest con and expensive cases. Gro...\nREAD MORE"
