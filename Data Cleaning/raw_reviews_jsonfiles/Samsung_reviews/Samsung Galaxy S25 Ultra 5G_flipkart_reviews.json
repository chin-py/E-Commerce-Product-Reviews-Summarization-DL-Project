You even get 6 months of gemini advanced subscription for free.\nThe only downside is the downgraded s-pen. If you're upgrading from an old cheaper phone then this phone is completely worth the upgrade, but if you already own an s23 or s24 ultra or equivalent device, i wouldn't recommend upgrading since most of the changes are very minor."
