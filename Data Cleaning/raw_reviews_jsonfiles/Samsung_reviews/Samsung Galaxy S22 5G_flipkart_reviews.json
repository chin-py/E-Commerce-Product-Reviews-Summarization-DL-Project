Will never disappoint you in terms of photography and videography.\n2. Performance is fantastic, without a single lag or stutters and pretty much consistent in day to day tasks, this is my primary device and I do a lot of calls, mailing, Excel scanning stuffs and never lets me down in time of need.\nHaven't found any heating issues while doing regular tasks.\n3....\nREAD MORE"

But after using it for more than 10 days, I don't at all feel the heat.\nI don't play games on the phone so that might be one of the factors. Coming to the phone, it's stunning. The display just takes your breath away everytime you look at it. The back cameras are really good but the front cam loses out a bit. The selfies are just good enough. I purchased a 25w charger as I found out t...\nREAD MORE"

While traveling and using GPS for 1-2hrs it got me end of the day with 40% left. So 1 day battery life is there.
