Cameras are good (may not be as good as Pixel), design is so unique. Love the flat screen, it's so practical. Display is top notch! My previous 2 phones were OnePlus and seriously considered OP12 as well, but the AI features stood out. Phone software is well optimised and battery lasts me full day fully. I use 25w charger and it charges from 35-100% in around 50mins. ...\nREAD MORE"

Battery lasting more than 18 - 20 hours with 7 - 8 hours of SOT. If you get a tempered glass kindly get a thin one, because if you get a thick one the Ultrasonic sensor won't work even if you increase your touch sensitivity.\n\nOverall a great flagship experience everyone should at least use once in your life time."
