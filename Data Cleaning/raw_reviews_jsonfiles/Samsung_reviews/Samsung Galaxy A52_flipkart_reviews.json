Low light might have some room for improvement. The quality of the pictures are really top class for this range. Samsung cameras do add a little bit of brightness & color to them but they don't bother much. Macro is not something I often use. Focus is great but takes...\nREAD MORE"

Those who are thinking to buy Redmi Note 10 pro max instead of Galaxy A52, I would say please re-consider your plan and buy Galaxy A52 (Also, increase your budget a bit :) ). You have to use this phone anyways for 3 to 4 years on an average. One UI is pleasing to your eyes and fingers. Also, you feel more secure using this phone compared to MIUI. Knox security and Samsung's brand value plays a huge role in this. ...\nREAD MORE"

But does consume a bit more power.\nThe pics captured are really good, but I felt the default camera app to be lacking in default mode and overcomplicated in the pro mode.\nThe battery comfortably lasts for more than 24 hours on average use.\nThere is a lot of bloatware installed with the phone which I felt was slowing down the phone.\nAlthough 5G is not rolled out in India, this device with the current price tag should have come with 5G support."
